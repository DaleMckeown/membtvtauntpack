# MembTV Taunt Pack
This is just a fun taunt pack mod for Age of Empires 2 (DE), containing some classic MembTV quotes.

To request a new taunt, either:

- Submit a request to this thread on the forums: https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/membtv-taunt-submissions/200200
- Submit a PR with the new audio file added. The sound file must be in the `\Source\Audio\` file and in `.wem` format (Use wwise to convert `.wav` files to the `.wem` format).
